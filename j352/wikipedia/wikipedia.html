        <h2>Location History</h2>
        <p>
            Their first pizzeria was opened in Adelphi, Maryland in 1955 on University Boulevard (Maryland Route
            193) in Adelphi Shopping Center near the University of
            Maryland, College Park.
            <br>
            The first franchise was granted to the Fireside

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Ledo Pizza is <i>rectangular</i> in shape and is known for its very thin crust, sweet sauce, thick
            pepperoni (one per slice; optional), and smoked provolone cheese, often using the tagline "Ledo
            Pizza is square, because we don't cut corners."
            <br>
            <br>
            The restaurant chain has been called by several names, including Ledo Pizza and Ledo Pizza and
            Pasta.
            <br>
            <br>
            The original location in Adelphi, Maryland, at the Adelphi Shopping Center was established in 1955.
            The name on its website is "Tommy Marcos' Ledo Restaurant. The original location is not listed in
            the restaurant finder maintained by website. The omission from the chain's website may be related to
            a legal dispute between the Ledo chain and the Marcos family.
            <br>
            <br>
            The same pizza based on the same family recipe is served at TJ Elliots in Bowie, Maryland, along
            with many of the other signature Italian-American and family dishes. TJ Elliots is owned and
            operated by Tommy and Jimmy Marcos.

            In September 2009, the Marcos family announced that the original Ledo's restaurant would be moving a
            few miles from its original location to downtown College Park. The original location closed in July
            2010, and the new location opened for business on August 27, 2010. The College Park restaurant
            closed in November 2020 and reopened a year later as a Ledo franchise location.
