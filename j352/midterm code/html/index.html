        This is a story about proving, with data, that <a href="https://youtu.be/3KL9mRus19o">Blackstreet by No
            Diggity</a> is timeless.
        <br>

        Until recently, it was impossible to measure the popularity of older music. Billboard charts and album sales
        only tell us about a song's popularity at the time of its release.
        <br>
        <br>
        But now we have Spotify, a buffet of all music, new and old. Tracks with fewer plays are falling into obscurity.
        And those with more plays are remaining in the cultural ether.
        <br>
        <br>
        20 years have passed since No Diggity's release. Its popularity on Spotify, relative to every other song from
        the 90's, is a strong sigfnal for whether it will be remembered by our children's children. So let's examine
        every song that ever charted, 1990-1999, and rank them on number of plays on Spotify, today.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Out of the entire catalog of music from the 90s, these are the tracks on the trajectory to survive. </b> Some
        of my friends were deeply disturbed by what's been lost in time (e.g., Pearl Jam). And no Diggity isn't just
        anecdotally timeless, it's the fifth-most played song from the 90s.
        <br>
        <br>
        Note the tracks that hardly charted on Billboard, in their day. Smells Like Teen Spirit, a track that never
        reached the Billboard Top 5 when it was released in 1992, is now the most-played song from the 90s.
        <br>
        <br>
        Using Spotify plays, we can also see which rappers are still remembered from the early days of hip-hop (e.g.,
        Biggie vs. Tupac).
    </p>
    <img src="images/biggie-tupac.jpeg" alt="biggie v. tupac">
    <p>
        Biggie has three of the Top 10 hip-hop songs between 1986 and 1999. This is a strong signal that future
        generations will remember Biggie as the reference artist of the 80s and 90s hip-hop. And there's No Diggity as
        the top - perhaps it's that glorious Dr. Dre verse.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hip hop heads will lament the omission of Rakim, Public Enemy, or Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt. It's a depressing
        reality that exists for every genre and generation: not every artist will be remembered. The incoming generation
        will control what's relevant from the 90s and carried into the future, independent of quality and commercial
        success. For rock, that might be Blink-182. For electronica, that might be Sandstorm.
    </p>
    <!--PRESENT-DAY POPULARITY: FIVE DECADES OF MUSIC-->
    <p>
        <b>Past popularity doesn't always translate into present-day popularity.
        </b> Here's how that manifests across all genres and decades.
        <br>
        <br>
        For the entire 1980s, Don't Stop Believin' is the most-played song on Spotify. This song barely charted on
        Billboard. From the 70s: Bohemian Rhapsody. If we were to time travel to either decade, no one would reasonably
        believe that these two songs would be cultural touchstones for their repsective decades in 2015.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Over time, our biggest stars will fade, and sometumes surprising acts emerge.
        </b> Let's examine this pattern to better understand the present-day popularity of historic superstars.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are the top-5 tracks from the 90s, along with Billboard performance in the year of each song's release
        date.
