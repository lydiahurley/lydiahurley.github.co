        This is a story about proving, with data, that <a href="https://youtu.be/3KL9mRus19o">Blackstreet by No
            Diggity</a> is timeless.
        <br>
        <br>
        Until recently, it was impossible to measure the popularity of older music. Billboard charts and album sales
        only tell us about a song's popularity at the time of its release.
        <br>
        <br>
        But now we have Spotify, a buffet of all music, new and old. Tracks with fewer plays are falling into
        obscurity.
        And those with more plays are remaining in the cultural ether.
        <br>
        <br>
        20 years have passed since No Diggity's release. Its popularity on Spotify, relative to every other song
        from
        the 90's, is a strong sigfnal for whether it will be remembered by our children's children. So let's examine
        every song that ever charted, 1990-1999, and rank them on number of plays on Spotify, today.
    </p>
    <img src="images/90s-hits.jpeg" alt="what's remembered from the 90s">
    <p>
        <b>Out of the entire catalog of music from the 90s, these are the tracks on the trajectory to survive. </b>
        Some
        of my friends were deeply disturbed by what's been lost in time (e.g., Pearl Jam). And no Diggity isn't just
        anecdotally timeless, it's the fifth-most played song from the 90s.
        <br>
        <br>
        Note the tracks that hardly charted on Billboard, in their day. Smells Like Teen Spirit, a track that never
        reached the Billboard Top 5 when it was released in 1992, is now the most-played song from the 90s.
        <br>
        <br>
        Using Spotify plays, we can also see which rappers are still remembered from the early days of hip-hop
        (e.g.,
        Biggie vs. Tupac).
    </p>
    <img src="images/biggie-tupac.jpeg" alt="biggie v. tupac">
    <p>
        Biggie has three of the Top 10 hip-hop songs between 1986 and 1999. This is a strong signal that future
        generations will remember Biggie as the reference artist of the 80s and 90s hip-hop. And there's No Diggity
        as
        the top - perhaps it's that glorious Dr. Dre verse.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hip hop heads will lament the omission of Rakim, Public Enemy, or Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt. It's a
        depressing
        reality that exists for every genre and generation: not every artist will be remembered. The incoming
        generation
        will control what's relevant from the 90s and carried into the future, independent of quality and commercial
        success. For rock, that might be Blink-182. For electronica, that might be Sandstorm.
    </p>
    <!--PRESENT-DAY POPULARITY: FIVE DECADES OF MUSIC-->
    <h1>graphic here</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Past popularity doesn't always translate into present-day popularity.
        </b> Here's how that manifests across all genres and decades.
        <br>
        <br>
        For the entire 1980s, Don't Stop Believin' is the most-played song on Spotify. This song barely charted on
        Billboard. From the 70s: Bohemian Rhapsody. If we were to time travel to either decade, no one would
        reasonably
        believe that these two songs would be cultural touchstones for their repsective decades in 2015.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Over time, our biggest stars will fade, and sometumes surprising acts emerge.
        </b> Let's examine this pattern to better understand the present-day popularity of historic superstars.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are the top-5 tracks from the 90s, along with Billboard performance in the year of each song's release
        date.
    </p>

    <p>
        There were 41 more popular songs in 1991 than Smells Like Teen Spirit: End of the Road (Boyz II Men), Baby Got
        Back
        (Sir Mix Alot), Save The Best For Last (Vanessa Williams), and I’m Too Sexy (Right Said Fred).
        <br>
        <br>
        Since 1992, these songs have slowly faded from culture with the incoming generation, whereas Nirvana’s music has
        not
        only maintained its popularity, but augmented it.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, in 1961, Bobby Lewis’s Tossin’ and Turnin’ spent 7 weeks at #1. For all intents and purposes, Bobby
        Lewis was the Beyonce of 1961. Yet, have you heard of it? Do you know how Bobby Lewis is?
        <br>
        <br>
        Meanwhile, Etta James’ debut album dropped the same year, with At Last peaking on Billboard at #68.
        <br>
        <br>
        Music historians will regard Bobby Lewis as a pioneer in rock and roll and R&B, yet whatever led to Tossin’ and
        Turnin’s popularity in 1961 has faded over time. His music, for countless reasons, didn’t preserve in the same
        way
        as Etta James’.
        <br>
        <br>
        One hypothesis: Tossin’ and Turnin’s success had more to do than just the song…perhaps Bobby Lewis was a huge
        personality. Great looks. Amazing dancer. <b> When we examine pop hits, popularity is so much more than song
            quality.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        But future generations don’t remember Bobby Lewis’s’ dancing and good looks. Spotify only catalogues his music.
        And
        unfortunately, that quality didn’t endure in the same way as At Last. (And of course, we have not even
        considered
        the role of covers, samples, and movie soundtracks, etc. - a future project to undertake).
        <br>
        <br>
        And for this reason, it will be weird to hear future generations reverently listen to groups such as Nickleback
        -
        the kids only know their music, not what they culturally stood for in 2015.
        <br>
        <br>
        Thus far we’ve only examined two sets of data points: popularity at release (Billboard) and popularity today
        (Spotify).
        <br>
        <br>
        Yet, we don’t know what happened in-between: a song’s trajectory from peak popularity: whether it’s quickly
        fading
        from culture or holding steady to be played by future generations.
        <br>
        <br>
        If we were to review “Best of 2013” lists, Daft Punk’s Get Lucky and Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines would be the
        cultural touchstones. Get Lucky won the Grammy for Record of the Year and Blurred Lines was nominated.
        <br>
        <br>
        If my children’s children were to ask what we listened to in 2013, I’d pick either of Pharrell’s collaborations
        or
        someone like Calvin Harris.
        <br>
        <br>
        But that was two years ago, and we expect popularity to fade. Today, one track in particular has the most
        trajectory: OneRepublic’s Counting Stars. Counting Stars never had breakout success following its release, yet
        it
        has managed to stay in the cultural zeitgeist for more than a year after its peak popularity.
        <br>
        <br>
        One hypothesis: Counting Stars had a chance to spread organically via word-of-mouth since its April 2013
        release,
        cascading from indie music circles to casual listeners. Get Lucky, on the other hand, dominated music channels
        in
        its heyday. Most people likely heard the track via mass media rather than friends.
        <br>
        <br>
        When a track experiences such a rapid ascent, it’s a deal with the devil: the song achieves commercial success,
        but
        it also saturated culture in such a way that there’s immense listening fatigue among fans and fad-like
        connotations.
        <br>
        <br>
        Lana Del Rey’s Young and Beautiful and Arctic Monkey’s Do I Wanna Know look like modern equivalents of At Last:
        little commercial success on its release, but steady growth over time. Today in 2015, both tracks are at parity
        with
        Royals and Get Lucky, and you’d probably never guess it.
        <br>
        <br>
        What’s still popular from different periods in history is almost never the obvious choice. Accolades, Grammys,
        and
        cultural dominance mean nothing to future generations.
        <br>
        <br>
        The artists who have cult-followings and underground appeal: it’s a signal for some undefined musical quality
        that’s
        impossible for a hit song to replicate. Perhaps it means that they are culturally ahead of their time. Or
        perhaps
        generations will feel obligations to share it, for fear of it fading.
        <br>
        <br>
        Either way, time will tell.
