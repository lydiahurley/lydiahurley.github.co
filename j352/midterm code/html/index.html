        This is a story about proving, with data, that <a href="https://youtu.be/3KL9mRus19o">Blackstreet by No Diggity</a>  is timeless.

        Until recently, it was impossible to measure the popularity of older music. Billboard charts and album sales
        only tell us about a song's popularity at the time of its release.
        <br>
        <br>
        But now we have Spotify, a buffet of all music, new and old. Tracks with fewer plays are falling into obscurity.
        And those with more plays are remaining in the cultural ether.

        20 years have passed since No Diggity's release. Its popularity on Spotify, relative to every other song from
        the 90's, is a strongf sigfnal for whether it will be remembered by our children's children. So let's examine
        every song that ever charted, 1990-1999, and rank them on number of plays on Spotify, today.
