            Just a few weeks ago at the midterm elections on Nov. 8, Maryland voters hit the polls to cast their votes
            on the legalization of cannabis, making Maryland the 20th state in the U.S. to legalize recreational
            cannabis use.

            For Maryland residents, their stance on question four spans far beyond just legality. To many, the vote to
            legalize weed will mark a significant change in the way residents see the presence of recreational drugs
            changing in their social circles, as well as in their local communities.
            <br>
            <br>
            To many Marylanders, a “yes” vote to legalize marijuana seemed timely, even predictable. Google Trends
            showed an uptick in searches for the terms “weed legalization,” “dispensaries,” and “recreational marijuana”
            in Maryland all in the past year, with its peak hitting during election season.

            This is a big win for Maryland, said Laura Goodfield, president of the
            Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP) chapter at The George Washington University. Serving as president
            of the chapter has allowed her to able to connect with other passionate individuals in the field and broaden
            her understand of legalization as a public health issue, Goodfield said.

            “Maryland has been home to a lot of prohibitionist politicians who have been extremely outspoken about being
            anti-cannabis and even protested DC’s legalization. My hope is that the state will focus on equity and make
            sure not only licensure is going towards individuals disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs, but
            also business loans," Goodfield said.

            Despite this, a poll released in March 2021 by Goucher College found that two-thirds of Maryland adults
            favored
            the legalization of recreational marijuana. This was the highest percentage in support for legalization the
            state has ever seen, based on past polls, Goucher pollsters said.

            When it came to clinching a yes vote on Election Day, Maryland voters delivered overwhelmingly. 67 percent
            of
            voters voted yes on question four, while 32 percent voted no, according to The New York Times. Baltimore
            City,
            Prince George’s County, and Montgomery County were the three counties with the highest percentage of voters
            in
            favor, the publication’s election day polls revealed.

            Considering a smaller demographic, college-aged students who go to college in Maryland were overwhelmingly
            in
            favor of legalization. 90 percent of University of Maryland students surveyed were in favor of legalizing
            recreational cannabis, according to an opinion survey conducted three weeks after Election Day.
            <br>
            <br>
            Voters indicating their favoritism for recreational cannabis use doesn’t always translate to an equal amount
            of yes
            votes, though. Of the Maryland students surveyed, only 58 percent cast a yes vote on Election Day. The other
            41
            percent either did not vote in this election or were ineligible to vote in Maryland, according to the
            survey.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of the students surveyed voiced their concerns and uncertainty about the passing of this new
            legalization.
            The most common concern, with 53 percent of students listing it as their number one concern, was safety
            regarding where marijuana comes from. The second most common concern was high prices and taxes, with 41
            percent
            of students listing cost as a concern.

            Peter Reuter, a distinguished university professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at
            the
            University of Maryland, as well as an expert on drug policy, addressed some public health concerns. Reuter
            shared how the legalization of cannabis tends to change drug policy and access in other states and how that
            might impact Maryland.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another major trend we have seen in states that have legalized marijuana is a notable decrease in price,
            Reuter
            said. Some of the first states to legalize cannabis, like Washington and Colorado, are now able to produce
            at a
            much cheaper price. This is due to the loosened restrictions on how much cannabis growers can produce and
            where
            they’re able to produce it, said Reuter.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Marijuana could get a lot cheaper. Within two years of Michigan legalizing cannabis, prices fell 35 to 40
            percent. And it just keeps on falling,” Reuter said.
            <br>
            <br>
            As for the concerns related to safety in accessing marijuana, Reuter explained that dispensary cannabis is
            typically safer due to higher levels of regulation. However, potency is turning into a major issue, Reuter
            said.
            Most tested cannabis in the past few decades had only 5 to 25 percent THC, but dispensary-approved marijuana
            now
            can have anywhere from 50 to 90 percent THC, Reuter added. This is a concern, especially for daily users who
            are
            at risk for overuse.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thanks to the yes vote on Election Day, the Maryland Constitution will be amended so that individuals 21
            years
            or older in the state of Maryland will be authorized to use and possess marijuana. The Maryland General
            Assembly
            will also be authorized to "provide for the use, distribution, possession, regulation, and taxation of
            cannabis
            within the state," according to Ballotpedia.
